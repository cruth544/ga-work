# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# users = User.create([
#   {name: "Albert"},
#   {name: "Bethany"},
#   {name: "Charlie"},
#   ])

# orders = Order.create([
#   {name: "Anniversary"},
#   {name: "Birthday"},
#   {name: "Christmas"}
#   ])

# products = Product.create([
#   {name: "Apple"},
#   {name: "Bicycle"},
#   {name: "Carrot"}
#   ])
