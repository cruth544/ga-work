# Rails API Lab

## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

Using what we've learned in the Rails API lesson - about modifying routes and controllers - adapt what you built for all of the models on your Project 2 app.

Use the Insomnia tool - [Insomnia REST Client](http://insomnia.rest/) - to test your work and work through your errors, if needed!  Remember, the pattern from earlier: adjust the routes and then the controllers to control the flow of your application and give the user the appropriate [response code](http://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html).

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Create an `index` and `show` API endpoint for either your library app or your mumbler app (bonus if you set up API endpoints for both).
- Allow for create, update, and destroy functionality for at least one of these (bonus if you set up CRUD for both).



**Bonus:**

- Try out your API using `cURL` requests

#### Starter code

If you do not have more than one working model in your project 2 application you may use the provided [starter-code](starter-code) movie app.
