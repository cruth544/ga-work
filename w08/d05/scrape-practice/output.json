I enjoyed tropical daisy (tequila, jalapeño, and mango or blood orange) and smoky Suarez (mezcal and other stuff). Both also pretty good. It got busy by the end of happy hour. It was an Ok place for a first time visit."

        "review": "The only good thing is their happy hour.  And that's just because the happy hour starts at 3! Their menu is 75% drinksThey have about 12 options for food. They make their own ketchup. The bleu cheese burger is pretty good. Very filling. Ordered sweet potato fries on the side. Nothing special. Parking sucks.  Try the metered parking in the street or garage parking. Not sure if they validate."

        "review": "This review is strictly for happy hour...Happy hour - Mon - Fri 4p to 7p dailyWe decided to meet a small group of friends for happy hour on a Friday evening post work. Based on the reviews of this place and previous visits by our friends, we thought it was a good bet. Upon walking in, this place was slammed with patrons. We went to the bar area and found a couple stools near the end. We ordered some beers and wine for the group and for 1 type of beer and 1 type of wine, the bartender seemed pretty lost and struggled with our order. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt and repeated the order about 3 more times. Once we got our first round, there was seriously major spillage of our drinks at the bar. I try and let go of my OCD when possible, but come on dudes, no one likes their wine glasses dripping from a puddle of wine you had issues pouring. By the second round, I was hoping for a smoother order. This time it seemed like it too us forever to get grab the attention of the bartender. Not to mention, she disappeared fairly often on us. By this time, I was just annoyed. It shouldn't take this long to get the bartenders attention for another round, even when I'm accounting for the fact that it's busy. While the prices were great for happy hour, I don't think waiting so long for a drink outweighs my value of time spent here and the service I get from the bar. Maybe this might just be a better sit down type place."

        "review": "Finally had a chance to check out this new spot that opened up down the street from work.  Not many places in this side of town unless you roll down to 7th and Fig. Came for happy hour with a few co-workers to catch NCAA games.  The food items on the happy hour menu did not seem that great so we decided to ordered regular items to share.  Took a look at some pictures on Yelp and ordered the Smokey Fried Chicken and Pastrami Fries.  Let me tell you, I felt deceived by the portion size from the pictures.  I could not help to laugh a bit at first sight.  The items arrived in small skillets the size of my fist - $14 for 3 thin chicken breast strips with gravy and yam sauce and pastrami fries with a few cubes of pastrami for $9.  The wings for happy hour looked good.  It was $2.50 each.  The wings (2 pieces) took forever and was cold. The food was flavorful, but not justified for the price.  It seems the burgers are popular, but I tried enough gourmet burgers that I rarely crave.  Just give me a double-double at In-n-Out.  The environment felt like some hip, upscale, over priced joint that was not the friendliest.  The service was very slow and we were there early when it was empty.  My co-workers and I had the impression that they did not want to serve us from the beginning to the end.  It was reinforced in the end when a new waitress came to bring us our bill to close us out, while the one that helped us was there waiting on nearby tables.  This definitely was a first and very strange.  Aside from the $6 old fashion (on tap, but pretty good), we could not help feeling a bit ripped off.  There was nothing that would entice any of us to come back even though it is the only bar/restaurant by the office.  We hit up several other spots after to grab more food and drinks that was relaxed, fun, and less pretentious."

        "review": "Tried something new with my friends. It was a very mellow vibe. Went on a random Tuesday night and it wasn't packed at all.Had a good selection of beers and drinks. Sad I didn't get to hit up the happy hour (4 to 7) but got the sangria. It was a good mixture of wine and fruits, left a refreshing after taste.Had a hard decision on choosing foods so I split the kbbq burger and the bleu cheese burger (I didn't get it right the first time so close enough)My server Monti was awesome. He's super witty. He was patient since I didn't know what to order until later. Thankful for his attentiveness too!Need to go back to try some of the appetizers, split bread and dip appetizer. I wished I remember the name, because I wanted more!"
