        "review": "Happy Hour is from 5-8. They have free whiskey tasting events weekly, two pool tables and cigars. Don't pass up seven grand if you like whiskey and want a place to hang out and relax. The place gets crowded on weekends but that's to be expected. Always a chill place to hang out and catch up with friends."

        "review": "Updated Review:I still think this is one of the best bars in downtown.  The decor is fun...reminds me of an old man's smoking parlor.  There are pool tables and strong drinks.  These bartenders are artists.  I recommend the Sazerac cocktail and ask Leo to make it for you.  :)I like going when it's less crowded, think 7-9pm every night.  Right after happy hour, but before the night crowd comes.***************************************************************************NOTE:To whoever tried to use my name for a hook-up at the bar, stop being tacky and trashy.  I clearly would NOT have cheap and ghetto friends like that.  Get some class and stop trying to scam people."

        "review": "We were supposed to meet some friends here so we arrived around 6ish. Apparently they have a happy hour everyday until 7 or 8. The drinks were good, but not strong. It also took around 15 minutes to have someone give us drinks. Mind you the place wasn't crowded and there were 3 bartenders. This place is cool, but not for everyone."

        "review": "Mixologists? Yes please!!! This is hands down my new favorite downtown bar. Dropped by here on a Friday after a long day of work with some coworkers. What we didn't realize was that people like go home on Friday's instead of going to happy hour so Seven Grand was bar #4 on our hunt for a good hh crowd. After walking for what seemed like hours we finally settled down at Seven Grand despite it being pretty dead. My other concern walking in was all the dark liquor. I like to keep it clear so I was having a hard time choosing a drink until I found out that the bartenders are mixologists, score! I had 3 (or 4) different drinks and they were ALL delicious. I have no idea what they were but they all had whiskey and were amazing. Let me remind everyone, I'm NOT a whiskey drinker so this says something. Happy hour pricing was $2 off each of our drinks until 7 which isn't great but if you have enough drinks it pays off :)By 9 the place was packed and we were stumbling out. Will be back!"

        "review": "Used to be a cool happy hour bar until its head got too big.  My co-workers and I used to go to 7 Grand for drinks 2 - 3 times a week until a horrible incident with a new bartender.  Since then, we've found replacements (margaritas at Mas Malo work) but are still disappointed that 7 Grand has become too hip for its own good.  Hopefully the attitude will disappear before it loses too many of its loyal customers."

        "review": "the bartenders definitely take their time making drinks but thats because they use real ingredients. and for the gal friends i was with, they couldn't make the standard drink but had do it with a twist.  cool chill place.  happy hour from 5-7pm definitely brings the price down a bit (-$2) to soften the blow.  although the place kinda cleared out after 7....it must be hard times."

        "review": "This is my favorite bar to go to when around downtown. It only loses a star because it can get way packed on the weekends (which is both good and bad). The place is a whiskey bar with a rugged cabin type feel. They do stock a full bar, but just FYI for you vodka drinkers, they don't carry Grey Goose. They do offer happy hour daily until 7pm. Beers will usually run you between $7-10, mixed drinks about $12, and an extensive whiskey list that can range anywhere from $8-1200 (for a 55-year Macallan). The crowd here is generally pretty mellow and diverse. You'll fit right in with casual attire. I joke with my friends about how many plaid shirts we can count in the place. They don't offer much seating but there are areas to the left of the bar, in the back room (when its open), and stools around the pool tables. They also have a covered outdoor area with limited seating and can be a pain to navigate around when busy. You'll find that most people just stand around chit chatting.I find that the best place to park is across the street behind Bottega Louie in the public lot."

        "review": "This place blows for happy hour, i.e. 5-7pm, because its DEAD.  But soon after 7pm it gets packed.  But I don't ever recall waiting in any lines.  Random/diverse crowd which is what I like about it.  Dark wood/manly decor.  Pool tables in the middle.  Room in the back that you can rent out for private parties.  If you get the munchies you're sh*t outta luck because they just have small bags of chips which they sell for some absurd amount.  BUT they let us order pizza from down the street!!!  Good selection of music (me loves Arcade Fire/Keep the car running).Update:  I just went back this past Thursday night and I've got to say that I was pretty dissappointed with the \"change\" that seven grand has undergone.  This used to be one of my favorite chill bars but now they have a dj that is spinning top 40 music, etc., way too many people, and the crowd isnt as eclectic anymore.  I don't know if this dj thing is just a Thursday night thing (because prior to my last visit I used to go to this bar on fri/sat) or if seven grand has metamorphosized into a bar that I don't like anymore."

        "review": "Who doesn't want to be sucked into the old world and be reminded of how the greats in Edinburgh set the tone for the birth of these lovely whiskey bars and lounges.  That's the charm of Seven Grand.  The wooden dinosaur and it's many jackalope heads invite you into a place that time seems to have forgotten.  That's just where the fun begins...Their drinks are definitely to-die-for.  I've made many non believers of whiskey instant fans with their vast selection unto the hundreds of single malt whiskey.  I believe in the philosophy that there's a whiskey for everybody.  I'm a simple guy and I've been bewitched by the apropos Old Fashioned made with the Maker's Mark, Angostura Bitters, Sugar and a twist of zest.  The bartenders at this bar really understand all the characteristics of their whiskeys.  They allow the whiskeys who enjoy a bit of relaxation to sit comfortably among the floating iceberg as its flavor matures in front of your eyes.  Among some of their signature drinks such as the aforementioned Old Fashioned and the Mint Julep, the Sazerac Rye Cocktail takes the cake for quality and flavor.  With a slight Absinthe rinse, the Sazerac's flavor is exploited to its full potential.  These drinks leave bar-goers simply \"oohing\" and \"aahing\" with enjoyment.The only con is that on packed nights, the wait time for a bartender's attention can reach well beyond 10-15 minutes.  But I forgive them because I know that they're nurturing the process of their concoction and I know for a fact that once I set my lips on that glass, I'll forget my sorrows and succumb to the magic that is Seven Grand.Recommendation: go during happy hour and on the weeknights when they have live bands going."

        "review": "We live downtown and had forgotten that Monday nights are the \"slow\" nights for bars and some close on Mondays (i.e. Broadway Bar and Golden Gopher). So, we made a big circle and dropped by here, instead. While we do not really like Mas Malo which shares the front door with this place, we don't mind bar-bars. I had not been here before, since I am relatively new to downtown. First thing I noticed was there were a lot of stairs up and no elevator. I'm not saying I need the elevator. I was wondering what the really drunk people who could potentially have been kicked out for having drank too much do to get back outside -- tumble down the stairs? Next thing I noticed is the stairs are plaid and covered. Do they spend a lot of money shampooing them when people find going down the steps too much for their alcohol-filled stomachs?Once we got to the top (it's a bit dim inside), next thing I saw were a couple of pool tables. Cool. Not that I'd play on these tables...  then I saw a bunch of deer heads (real or not, I don't know). I suppose that is only fitting since the Seven Grand sign hanging out in front sports a deer's head.I sat down with my man and looked at the list. My man always gets the same thing, so I am usually the one who looks at what's on draft and what's on the drink menu. The laminated white menu had pages of scotch. Pages with an s. I saw a small section for bourbon, but, did not see the beer list and figured I should just forgo the bottled beers, anyways, and look at what's on tap. I do not drink anything with more alcohol content than sake or soju because I would have serious problems (yes, I'm a cheap date). They had Guinness, Chimay, something I asked what it was and the bartender said it was a cross between an IPA and a Blonde (or whatever), and 3-4 others I don't care so much for. So, I just got the Chimay. I noticed the bartender uses his combination 1-shot/2-shot measuring tool to put 2 shots of liquor in the cup over the ice. I thought most people just put the standard-size spout on and count 2 seconds? Maybe the bar owners are stingy and measure the volume leftover at the end of the week.  ..I am being facetious.Since it was a Monday night, there were only a few other people in the bar with us. On the chalkboard, I saw happy hour lasts until 7pm and Monday-Wednesday(I think..) there is live music starting at 10pm."
